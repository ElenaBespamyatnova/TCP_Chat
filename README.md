**TCP Console Chat**

This application allows users to communicate via a console-based chat system using the TCP protocol. The chat system operates with a server-client architecture, where users must first start the server and then the clients to begin communication. Users have the option to either authorize themselves, register as a new user, or remain a guest. Once in the chat, users can exchange messages with others who have joined the chat.

_Getting Started_
Starting the Server: Run the server application to initialize the chat system. Make sure the server is up and running before attempting to connect clients.

Starting the Clients: Run the client application and follow the prompts to choose the desired authentication option. Enter necessary information as prompted.

Communicating: Once inside the chat, users can type and send messages. Messages are received by all participants within the chat.

_Usage_
To interact with the chat system, users can follow these steps:

_Choosing Options_: Upon starting the client application, users can choose one of the following options:

Authorization: If already registered, enter the credentials to log in.
Registration: If a new user, register with necessary details.
Remain a Guest: Enter the chat without authentication.
Sending Messages: Once inside the chat, users can type messages and send them to other participants.

_Menu Options_: To access the menu, type "menu" in the chat. Users will then be presented with the following options:

Get History: To view the chat history with a specific interlocutor, enter the name of the interlocutor and the date of the dialogue.
Exit: To leave the chat and disconnect from the application.

_History Retrieval_:
If the user is authorized, they can select the option to receive history and enter the name of the interlocutor along with the desired date of the conversation.
If the user is logged in as a guest, they will be prompted to log in to access the chat history.

_Note_
This application functions in a console environment and requires proper network connectivity. Ensure that the server and client devices are connected to the same network for seamless communication.
